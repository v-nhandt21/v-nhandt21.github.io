excerpt: 'Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems are increas- ingly vulnerable to sophisticated spoofing attacks, particularly those involving deepfake audio. This paper presents our ap- proach to the challenges in Task 1 of the ASVSpoof 2024 com- petition, focusing on deepfake detection to classify utterances is spoof or bonafide. To enhance model robustness, we employed self-supervised learning (SSL) models, specifically fine-tuning WavLM for feature extraction due to its superior performance in noisy environments. We utilized RawBoost augmentation techniques to simulate real-world audio distortions. Experimen- tal results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves detection accuracy, achieving an EER of 2.85% with WavLM and further reducing to 2.69% with a fusion of WavLM and Wav2Vec2 models.'
