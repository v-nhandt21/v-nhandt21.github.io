This competition is sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society and MathWorks

The IEEE Signal Processing Societyâ€™s 2022 Signal Processing Cup (SP Cup) will be a synthetic speech attribution challenge. Teams will be requested to design and develop a system for synthetic speech attribution. This means, given an audio recording representing a synthetically generated speech track, to detect which method among a list of candidate ones has been used to synthesize the speech. The detector must rely on the analysis of the speech signal through signal processing and machine learning techniques.
